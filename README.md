# üß†Inspiration

Modern cloud-native systems rely heavily on microservices and serverless architecture like AWS Lambda. While convenient, they are also vulnerable to unpredictable failures and cascading issues. Inspired by the principles of Chaos Engineering‚Äîpopularized by Netflix‚Äôs Chaos Monkey‚Äîwe wanted to intentionally inject failures into Lambda functions to make systems more resilient, fault-tolerant, and observable. The goal was to empower developers to test their assumptions and prepare for real-world failures before they happen in production.

## ‚öôÔ∏èWhat it does
chaos_lambda is a Python library that lets you inject controlled failures into AWS Lambda functions using simple decorators. It supports:
Latency Injection: Add artificial delays (fault_type: "latency").
Exception Injection: Throw custom exceptions (fault_type: "exception").
HTTP Error Code Injection: Return specific error codes (fault_type: "status_code").
The configuration is pulled dynamically from AWS SSM Parameter Store, making it controllable in real-time‚Äîwithout code changes or redeployments. It also supports rate-based injection and per-function toggling via environment variables.

## üõ†Ô∏è How we built it
Used Python decorators to intercept Lambda execution and inject faults.
Stored fault configurations (like delay, error codes, exception message, etc.) in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.
Used boto3 to fetch configurations during Lambda runtime.
Enabled selective injection using the CHAOS_PARAM environment variable.
Added rate-limiting support to randomly inject faults based on defined probability.
Tested locally and deployed on AWS Lambda with IAM permissions for ssm:GetParameter.

## üßó Challenges we ran into
Managing fine-grained IAM permissions for accessing SSM parameters securely.
Ensuring fault injection logic doesn't break the Lambda's core functionality when disabled.
Implementing rate control accurately to reflect randomized behavior.
Simulating production-like behavior in a hackathon timeframe without full-scale infrastructure.

## üèÜ Accomplishments that we're proud of
Developed a working, deployable solution that brings Chaos Engineering to AWS Lambda, which is often underexplored.
Created a lightweight and easily pluggable decorator-based approach‚Äîminimal intrusion, maximum control.
Demonstrated real-world scenarios like latency spikes, thrown exceptions, and 5xx errors‚Äîall configurable remotely.

## üìö What we learned
Gained deep insights into serverless observability and fault modeling.
Understood the importance of feature toggles via SSM to control experiments safely.
Practiced infrastructure as code principles while working with AWS IAM, Lambda, and SSM.
Explored chaos testing strategies and their impact on system resilience.

## üöÄ What's next for Chaos Injection for AWS Lambda - chaos_lambda
Add support for network-level faults, resource exhaustion, and cold-start simulation.
Build a Chaos Dashboard with real-time toggles and metrics.
Integrate with AWS CloudWatch and X-Ray for deeper observability.
Extend the library for Step Functions, Fargate, and other serverless components.
Contribute it as an open-source tool for DevOps teams practicing Chaos Engineering.

``chaos_lambda`` is a small library injecting chaos into `AWS Lambda
<https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`_.
It offers simple python decorators to do `delay`, `exception` and `statusCode` injection for your AWS Lambda function.
This allows to conduct small chaos engineering experiments for your serverless application
in the `AWS Cloud <https://aws.amazon.com>`_.

* Support for Latency injection using ``fault_type: latency``
* Support for Exception injection using ``fault_type: exception``
* Support for HTTP Error status code injection using ``fault_type: status_code``
* Using for SSM Parameter Store to control the experiment using ``is_enabled: true``
* Support for adding rate of failure using ``rate``. (Default rate = 1)
* Per Lambda function injection control using Environment variable (``CHAOS_PARAM``)

Install
--------
.. code:: shell

    pip install chaos-lambda


Example
--------
.. code:: python

    # function.py

    import os
    from chaos_lambda import inject_fault

    # this should be set as a Lambda environment variable
    os.environ['CHAOS_PARAM'] = 'chaoslambda.config'

    @inject_fault
    def handler(event, context):
        return {
            'statusCode': 200,
            'body': 'Hello from Lambda!'
        }

Considering a configuration as follows:

.. code:: json

    {
        "fault_type": "exception",
        "delay": 400,
        "is_enabled": true,
        "error_code": 404,
        "exception_msg": "This is chaos",
        "rate": 1
    }

When excecuted, the Lambda function, e.g ``handler('foo', 'bar')``, will produce the following result:

.. code:: shell

    exception_msg from config chaos with a rate of 1
    corrupting now
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    File "/.../chaos_lambda.py", line 199, in wrapper
        raise Exception(exception_msg)
    Exception: This is chaos

Configuration
-------------
The configuration for the failure injection is stored in the `AWS SSM Parameter Store
<https://aws.amazon.com/ssm/>`_ and accessed at runtime by the ``get_config()``
function:

.. code:: json

    {
        "fault_type": "exception",
        "delay": 400,
        "is_enabled": true,
        "error_code": 404,
        "exception_msg": "This is chaos",
        "rate": 1
    }

To store the above configuration into SSM using the `AWS CLI <https://aws.amazon.com/cli>`_ do the following:

.. code:: shell

    aws ssm put-parameter --name chaoslambda.config --type String --overwrite --value "{ "delay": 400, "is_enabled": true, "error_code": 404, "exception_msg": "This is chaos", "rate": 1, "fault_type": "exception"}" --region eu-west-1

AWS Lambda will need to have `IAM access to SSM <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-paramstore-access.html>`_.

.. code:: json

    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "ssm:DescribeParameters"
                ],
                "Resource": "*"
            },
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "ssm:GetParameters",
                    "ssm:GetParameter"
                ],
                "Resource": "arn:aws:ssm:eu-north-1:12345678910:parameter/chaoslambda.config"
            }
        ]
    }


Supported Faults:
---------------------
``chaos_lambda`` currently supports the following faults:

* `latency` - Add latency in the AWS Lambda execution
* `exception` - Raise an exception during the AWS Lambda execution
* `status_code` - force AWS Lambda to return a specific HTTP error code
